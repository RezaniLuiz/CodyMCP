**CodyMCP** is a free browser extension that turns DeepSeek, Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Qwen or Arena into a Roblox Studio AI agent.
Control Roblox Studio with AI directly from your browser - read/edit scripts, run Luau, generate assets, all from a normal AI chat. No API key, no terminal, no coding needed.

Six AI providers are supported: **DeepSeek** (chat.deepseek.com, recommended), **Google Gemini** (gemini.google.com), **Kimi** (kimi.com, Moonshot AI), **GLM** (chat.z.ai, Z.ai), **Qwen** (chat.qwen.ai) and **Arena** (arena.ai, a multi-model playground). Gemini and Kimi can be unstable: Gemini tends to stop using the Roblox tools in long sessions, and Kimi sometimes uses its own native tools instead of the Roblox commands. On Arena, use **Direct** mode (CodyMCP only supports Direct; it blocks Start in Battle / Side-by-Side / Agent modes). DeepSeek is the recommended provider.

## How it works

```
AI chat (DeepSeek / Gemini / Kimi / GLM / Qwen / Arena, in your browser) -> CodyMCP Extension -> Bridge (your PC) -> Roblox Studio
```

The extension runs inside the chat page (DeepSeek, Gemini, Kimi, GLM, Qwen or Arena). When you type a request, it sends commands to the Bridge running on your PC, which drives Roblox Studio through the built-in MCP server.

## Setup

### 1. Download the zip and install the extension

Download the latest zip from the **Releases** page and extract it. The zip contains both the **Bridge** and the **extension folder**.

To load the extension:

- Go to `edge://extensions` (Edge) or `chrome://extensions` (Chrome)
- Enable **Developer mode** (top right toggle)
- Click **Load unpacked**
- Select the `codymcp-extension` folder from the extracted zip

### 2. Start Roblox Studio and enable MCP

Open Studio and load a Place, then enable MCP (first time only):

- Click **Assistant AI** in the top bar
- Click **...** (top right of the Assistant panel)
- Click **Manage MCP Servers**
- Click **Enable Studio as MCP Server**

### 3. Run the Bridge

Double-click `start.bat` inside the extracted folder. A small window opens, that means the Bridge is running.

### 4. Start a session

Go to https://chat.deepseek.com (recommended), https://gemini.google.com, https://www.kimi.com, https://chat.z.ai, https://chat.qwen.ai or https://arena.ai and open a new chat. The CodyMCP bar appears above the input box. Click **Start session**. Type what you want to build.

> Only works on chat.deepseek.com, gemini.google.com, kimi.com, chat.z.ai, chat.qwen.ai and arena.ai - it will not work on any other site.
> On Arena, keep the mode dropdown on **Direct** - CodyMCP blocks Start in Battle / Side-by-Side / Agent modes (it only drives a single Direct reply).
> Gemini and Kimi can be unstable (model behavior, not the extension): Gemini may stop using the Roblox tools after a while, and Kimi may use its own native tools instead. If the AI starts answering in plain text instead of acting, remind it to use the commands or start a new session.
